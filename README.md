# Unofficial-SSX-Fabric-Connector
An unofficial port of https://github.com/ServerSelectorX/ServerSelectorX-Connector to fabric

## Reason for archival
Turns out there is an option in SSX that lets you get all the functionality of this mod, without this mod.
Refer to #1 for details on that.
These features probably didn't exist when this mod was created, but honestly I can't remember.
TLDR: This mod is not needed anymore, it is remaining archived incase someone might find a use for it in the furture.

This is a sanctioned unofficial port that allows you to connect a sub-server to one hub server and report playercount, max playercount, and online status.

**This does not have support for SSX addons**

**Note: In order to use this mod you will need to use a bungeecord for fabric mod like:** [Fabric Proxy](https://github.com/OKTW-Network/FabricProxy)
## What is this port intended for?
This port is intended for preexisting spigot-based server networks that want to be able to add a fabric server to their roster (ex: A vanilla SMP)
